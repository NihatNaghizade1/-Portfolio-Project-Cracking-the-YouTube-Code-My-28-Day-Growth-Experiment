🎥 Cracking the YouTube Code – 28-Day Growth Experiment

📌 Overview

This project documents my 28-day YouTube growth experiment, where I applied data-driven marketing strategies to grow visibility, engagement, and audience retention. Instead of relying on guesswork, I approached my channel as a digital product, using structured methods such as A/B testing, funnel optimization, and performance analytics.

The experiment combined SEO, behavioral analytics, design theory, and automation to validate how a disciplined content strategy can rapidly scale a YouTube channel.
